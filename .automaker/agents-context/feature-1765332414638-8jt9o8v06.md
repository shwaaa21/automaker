Starting code implementation...

🔧 Tool: Glob
Let me look at the project structure more specifically, focusing on the components and the add new feature modal:
🔧 Tool: Glob

🔧 Tool: Grep
Let me search for the add new feature modal specifically:
🔧 Tool: Grep

🔧 Tool: Read
Now I can see the add feature dialog in the board-view.tsx file. It currently has a lot of settings in a single view. Let me also check the tabs component and dialog component to understand what's available:
🔧 Tool: Read

🔧 Tool: Read
Now I have a good understanding of what I need to do. Let me create a task list to track the implementation:
🔧 Tool: TodoWrite
Now let me implement the tabbed interface for the Add Feature Dialog. I'll need to:

1. Import the Tabs components
2. Reorganize the dialog content into three tabs:
   - **Prompt tab** (MessageSquare icon): Description + Category
   - **Model tab** (Settings/Gear icon): Model selection + Thinking level (with Claude/Codex separation)
   - **Testing tab** (FlaskConical icon): Skip tests checkbox + Verification steps
🔧 Tool: Edit
Now I need to add the Settings icon for the Model tab. Let me check what icons are already imported and add Settings2:
🔧 Tool: Edit

🔧 Tool: TodoWrite
Now let me refactor the Add Feature Dialog content to use tabs. I'll find the current content section and replace it:
🔧 Tool: Read
Now I'll replace the entire Add Feature Dialog content with a tabbed interface:
🔧 Tool: Edit

🔧 Tool: TodoWrite
Now I need to apply the same refactoring to the Edit Feature Dialog. Let me read the Edit Feature Dialog section:
🔧 Tool: Read
Now let me replace the Edit Feature Dialog content with the tabbed interface:
🔧 Tool: Edit

🔧 Tool: TodoWrite
Input: {
  "todos": [
    {
      "content": "Refactor Add Feature Dialog into tabbed interface",
      "status": "completed",
      "activeForm": "Refactoring Add Feature Dialog into tabbed interface"
    },
    {
      "content": "Create Prompt tab with description, category fields",
      "status": "completed",
      "activeForm": "Creating Prompt tab with description, category fields"
    },
    {
      "content": "Create Model tab with Claude and Codex models + thinking options",
      "status": "completed",
      "activeForm": "Creating Model tab with Claude and Codex models + thinking options"
    },
    {
      "content": "Create Testing tab with skip tests and verification steps",
      "status": "completed",
      "activeForm": "Creating Testing tab with skip tests and verification steps"
    },
    {
      "content": "Apply same refactoring to Edit Feature Dialog",
      "status": "completed",
      "activeForm": "Applying same refactoring to Edit Feature Dialog"
    }
  ]
}The implementation is complete! Let me verify that the build passes by checking for any TypeScript errors:
🔧 Tool: Bash
Input: {
  "command": "cd /Users/shirone/Documents/Projekty/automaker/app && npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | head -50",
  "description": "Check for TypeScript errors",
  "timeout": 60000
}The existing errors are from an `example` directory and unrelated to my changes. The main source code compiles without the board-view.tsx errors, which means my changes are correct. Let me verify the specific file we edited:
🔧 Tool: Bash
These are configuration errors from running tsc outside of the Next.js project structure. These errors are not specific to my changes. Let me run the Next.js build to actually verify the code compiles:
🔧 Tool: Bash
The build errors are pre-existing issues unrelated to my changes (missing @anthropic-ai/sdk package and font fetching issues). The important thing is that my changes to board-view.tsx are syntactically correct and there are no TypeScript errors related to the tabs implementation.

Let me verify the file is syntactically valid by running a quick lint check:
🔧 Tool: Bash
The lint errors shown are pre-existing issues in the file - most are warnings about unused variables and a couple of escapement issues. The important thing is there are no errors about my tabs implementation or import statements being broken.

Let me fix the two unescaped apostrophe issues that are in my new code (lines 1652 and 1897):
🔧 Tool: Read

🔧 Tool: Edit

🔧 Tool: Read

🔧 Tool: Edit
Now let me verify there are no new lint errors introduced by my changes:
🔧 Tool: Bash

🔧 Tool: Bash
The lint errors are down from 15 to 13, and none of the remaining errors are related to my changes. All the errors/warnings are pre-existing issues (unused vars, `any` types, missing dependencies in hooks). The fix for the apostrophe issues worked.

Let me create a quick summary of the changes and mark the feature as verified:
🔧 Tool: mcp__automaker-tools__UpdateFeatureStatus
The feature has been implemented and marked for your manual review. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Summary

I've refactored the Add Feature and Edit Feature modals in `board-view.tsx` to use a tabbed interface, making it easier to navigate the settings. The changes include:

### New Tabbed Structure

**1. Prompt Tab (MessageSquare icon)**
- Feature description input with image dropzone
- Category autocomplete field

**2. Model Tab (Settings2/Gear icon)**
- **Claude (SDK) section** - Shows all Claude models (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus) with a "Native" badge
  - Thinking Level controls appear below when a Claude model is selected
- **Separator line**
- **OpenAI via Codex CLI section** - Shows all Codex models with a "CLI" badge
  - Note explaining Codex models don't support thinking levels

**3. Testing Tab (FlaskConical icon)**
- Skip automated testing checkbox
- Verification steps (only shown when skip tests is enabled)

### Files Modified
- `app/src/components/views/board-view.tsx` - Main implementation

### Technical Details
- Added `Tabs`, `TabsList`, `TabsTrigger`, `TabsContent` components from the existing UI library
- Added `Settings2` icon from lucide-react
- Applied same structure to both Add Feature and Edit Feature dialogs
- Fixed two lint issues (unescaped apostrophes)

The feature is now in "waiting_approval" status for your manual review since `skipTests=true`. Please test the modal in the application to verify it works as expected before committing.✅ Verifying implementation for: I want you to refactor the add new feature modal there are to many settings going on and its hard / annoyig to navigate lets split the settings in modal into tabs

## Follow-up Instructions

Im not sure about thoes cards for models we show title / desc and badges its too much i believe can we make them kinda more 'compact' tho

🔧 Tool: Read
Let me look at the `renderModelOptions` function to understand how models are currently rendered:
🔧 Tool: Grep

🔧 Tool: Read
Now I understand the current implementation. The model cards show:
1. A title (label)
2. A badge (e.g., "Fast", "Balanced", "Powerful")
3. A description

The user wants a more compact version. Let me also look at what the model options include:
🔧 Tool: Grep
Now I understand. Let me create a more compact version of the `renderModelOptions` function. I'll create a new compact version that:
1. Uses smaller buttons in a horizontal row
2. Shows just the model name (shorter version) and badge
3. No description - hover/tooltip can show it if needed
🔧 Tool: TodoWrite

🔧 Tool: Edit
Now the model buttons are much more compact - they show just the short name (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus, Max, Codex, Mini) in a horizontal row, similar to the thinking level buttons. The full description is available on hover via the `title` attribute.

Let me verify the code compiles:
🔧 Tool: Bash
All the errors are pre-existing issues (none related to my changes). The compact model selection is now implemented. Let me update the todo and mark the feature as verified:
🔧 Tool: TodoWrite
Input: {
  "todos": [
    {
      "content": "Create compact model selection UI",
      "status": "completed",
      "activeForm": "Creating compact model selection UI"
    }
  ]

Input: {
  "featureId": "feature-1765332414638-8jt9o8v06",

  "summary": "Made model selection buttons compact. Removed descriptions and badges from cards, now shows short model names (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus, Max, Codex, Mini) in horizontal row. Full description available on hover. Modified: board-view.tsx (renderModelOptions function)."
}Done! I've made the model selection cards more compact. Here's a summary of the changes:

## Changes Made

**Modified:** `app/src/components/views/board-view.tsx` - `renderModelOptions` function

### Before:
- Large card layout (2-column grid)
- Each card showed: title, badge, and description
- Took up a lot of vertical space

### After:
- Compact horizontal button row (similar to the thinking level buttons)
- Shows only short model names:
  - Claude models: "Haiku", "Sonnet", "Opus"
  - Codex models: "Max", "Codex", "Mini"
- Full description available on hover (via `title` attribute)
- No badges or descriptions cluttering the UI
- Much more compact and easier to navigate

The feature is now in **waiting_approval** status for your manual review. Please test the modal in the application to verify the compact model selection works as expected before committing.✓ Feature successfully verified and completed

🔧 Tool: Bash

🔧 Tool: Bash
Now I can analyze the changes and create a proper commit message. Based on the git diff, I can see several key changes:

1. **Modal refactoring with tabs**: The main change is in `board-view.tsx` where the add new feature modal has been reorganized into tabs (Prompt, Model, Testing)
2. **Dialog width increase**: The dialog component was updated to use `max-w-2xl` instead of `max-w-md`/`max-w-lg` for wider modals
3. **Model management cleanup**: Several model-related services had O3/O4 models removed and model string validation improved
4. **Model display improvements**: Model selection UI was made more compact with shorter names
5. **Feature list updates**: New features were added to the feature list

This appears to be a refactoring of the add new feature modal to improve navigation by organizing settings into tabs, along with some model management cleanup and UI improvements.
